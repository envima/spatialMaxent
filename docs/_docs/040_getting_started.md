LetÂ´s go! To start your adventure towards Species Distribution Modeling with spatial data just [download spatialMaxent](https://github.com/Baldl/spatialMaxent/blob/main/out/artifacts/spatialMaxent_jar.zip?raw=true). To run it successfully on your PC make sure you have at least Java 18 installed on your PC. You can check your Java version in the command line:

```console
java -version
```

If you do not have java installed yet you can, for example, download the latest [openJDK 19](https://jdk.java.net/19/). You can start spatialMaxent by running the spatialMaxent.bat file on windows or the spatialMaxent.jar file from the command line on ubuntu.
